TASK AT HAND...

- HoverProvider for builtins
-- add filter in server capabilities to stop client sending hover requests indiscriminately. Is that what that does?
-- nope don't think so - I think I just need to respond with an empty string in the data field if there is no hover for the requested token
-- if that doesn't work, then try sending back null (though that  doesn't appear to be allowed in the spec)

POSSIBLE REFACTORS / IMPROVEMENTS (we're mulling these over on a background thread)...

Do we need to think about making our server handle requests and responses concurrently (most probably).

Better logger. I think this might become apparent when we implement trace responses.
