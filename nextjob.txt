TASK AT HAND...

- add types, and map them to lexer token types. We're now getting into static evaluation for the first time.


POSSIBLE REFACTORS / IMPROVEMENTS (we're mulling these over on a background thread)...

Do we need to think about making our server handle requests and responses concurrently (most probably).

Better logger. I think this might become apparent when we implement trace responses.
