TASK AT HAND...
- column delta looks broken (see what happens with strings) - let's get better encoder tests written and sort that out.
- semantic token encoding - line termination (needed for at least block comments)
- add types, and map them to lexer token types


POSSIBLE REFACTORS (we're mulling these over on a background thread)...

Do we need to think about making our server handle requests and responses concurrently (most probably).

Better logger. I think this might become apparent when we implement trace responses.
