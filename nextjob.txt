implement proper initialized state, with error if other request received before initializedNotification.

make the server send back semantic tokens

When I have enough message handlers implemented, I think we could make a handlerfunc type for them. How many is enough?
I think I'll know when I know, but I suspect more than 3 is sensible, because I'm less experienced an so my predictions
won't be accurate.

do we need to think about making our server handle requests and responses concurrently (most probably)

implement trace logging (I think we're going to need an abstraction over slog)
