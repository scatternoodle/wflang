TASK AT HAND...

- get alias expression parsing working
- fix log dir panic issue ( newest issue in Github )

POSSIBLE REFACTORS / IMPROVEMENTS (we're mulling these over on a background thread)...

Do we need to think about making our server handle requests and responses concurrently (most probably).

Better logger. I think this might become apparent when we implement trace responses.
