TASK AT HAND...

Now that semantic tokens are working...
- do proper token encoding
-- first iteration without relative positions
-- second iteration with relative positions
- add types, and map them to lexer token types


POSSIBLE REFACTORS (we're mulling these over on a background thread)...

When I have enough message handlers implemented, I think we could make a handlerfunc type for them. How many is enough?
I think I'll know when I know, but I suspect more than 3 is sensible, because I'm less experienced an so my predictions
won't be accurate.

Do we need to think about making our server handle requests and responses concurrently (most probably).

Better logger. I think this might become apparent when we implement trace responses.
