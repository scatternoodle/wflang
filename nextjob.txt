doing signaturehelp...
- testing out the new way of doing docstrings - hover needs a tad work, then go sort the signaturehelp
- make signature label the actual full signature not the function name, e.g. min(lower, higher) as opposed to just "min"
- handle function params docstrings... ugh why didn't I foresee this when I hardcoded those full markdown strings :(
  let's make a FunctionDoc type for this, make internal unexported variables for this as I can't face yet another massive
  map copy function.
- once we're done, review whether we're pushing errors unnecessarily for sighelp failures... we want a message if something
  is indicating a bug, but we shouldn't get errors in the editor when a signature simply can't be found... that'll get
  very annoying for the user.
