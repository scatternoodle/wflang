make the server send back semantic tokens:
This is still not working and I don't know why. Try doing semantic tokesn on the toylsp project, see if it
works there?

- store last lexer/parser statements / tokens in server object
    uh oh, I don't think we actually store all of our tokens... we might need to just have a simple array of those in the AST.
- encode semantic tokens
- respond with semantic tokens

When I have enough message handlers implemented, I think we could make a handlerfunc type for them. How many is enough?
I think I'll know when I know, but I suspect more than 3 is sensible, because I'm less experienced an so my predictions
won't be accurate.

do we need to think about making our server handle requests and responses concurrently (most probably)

implement trace logging (I think we're going to need an abstraction over slog)
