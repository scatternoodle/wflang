doing signaturehelp...
- bug: not getting parser errors anymore, but now it's just returning blank for a valid builtin (whatever I try). Needs
  debugging.
- once we're done, review whether we're pushing errors unnecessarily for sighelp failures... we want a message if something
  is indicating a bug, but we shouldn't get errors in the editor when a signature simply can't be found... that'll get
  very annoying for the user.
