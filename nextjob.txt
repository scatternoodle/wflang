TASK AT HAND...

Now that semantic tokens are working...
- we're handling documentDidOpen but not documentDidChange - let's add handling for that next.
-- first iteration without relative positions
-- second iteration with relative positions
-- do unit tests for encoding
- add types, and map them to lexer token types


POSSIBLE REFACTORS (we're mulling these over on a background thread)...

Do we need to think about making our server handle requests and responses concurrently (most probably).

Better logger. I think this might become apparent when we implement trace responses.
