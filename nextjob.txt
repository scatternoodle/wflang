make the server send back semantic tokens:
>>> This is still not working and I don't know why. Try doing semantic tokens on the toylsp project, see if it
works there?
>>> YES IT DOES. WHY... WHY DID IT WORK FOR ME THERE?
>>> Have ripped out semantic tokens code and re-written a VERY MINIMAL version so I can iterate until it works. Just one type.
    No frills or cleverness.
>>> Next, let's look at a yo code generation of another language in a different project - also maybe change this to use
    plaintext instead of the new wflang language - this could well be an issue with the language configuration in vscode.

- store last lexer/parser statements / tokens in server object
    uh oh, I don't think we actually store all of our tokens... we might need to just have a simple array of those in the AST.
- encode semantic tokens
- respond with semantic tokens

When I have enough message handlers implemented, I think we could make a handlerfunc type for them. How many is enough?
I think I'll know when I know, but I suspect more than 3 is sensible, because I'm less experienced an so my predictions
won't be accurate.

do we need to think about making our server handle requests and responses concurrently (most probably)

implement trace logging (I think we're going to need an abstraction over slog)
